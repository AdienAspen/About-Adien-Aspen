## 🧠 My Work

I organize my projects across **two main domains**:

### 🤖 **AI/ML & Intelligent Systems**
Production-focused machine learning systems where data, models, and decision logic are orchestrated to solve real business problems.

**Focus areas:**
- End-to-end ML systems (data → models → decisions)
- Decision engines combining ML + explicit business rules
- Model orchestration and reproducible pipelines
- Evaluation-first design and auditability

**Current Projects:**
- **[ia-ml-credit-decision-engine](https://github.com/AdienAspen/ia-ml-credit-decision-engine)** - Credit approval system with multi-model orchestration, policy layer, and RHPAM integration
- **[ia-ml-ielts-essay-scoring](https://github.com/AdienAspen/ia-ml-ielts-essay-scoring)** - NLP-based essay scoring using DeBERTa transformers with trait-specific models

### 📱 **Mobile Android Development**
High-performance native Android applications with modern architecture and user-centric design.

**Tech Stack:**
- Kotlin (Native Android)
- Jetpack Compose (Declarative UI)
- MVVM Architecture + Flow (Reactive Streams)
- Room Database (Local Encrypted Storage)

**Current Projects:**
- **[mobile-android-personal-training-weight-lift](https://github.com/AdienAspen/mobile-android-personal-training-weight-lift)** - LEON-2026: Intelligent Weightlifting Assistant with proactive plate calculator, smart training co-pilot, and data snapshot technology
